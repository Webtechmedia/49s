				Responsible gambling means staying in control of how much time and money we spend gambling. Whether you are playing 49’s, Irish Lotto Bet, Virtual Racing or Rapido, gambling responsibly means treating the activity as just one form of entertainment in a balanced lifestyle. Just like with other forms of entertainment, gambling is a form of expenditure, and responsible gambling means not spending more money or time than we can reasonably afford, keeping in mind all our other responsibilities in life.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're concerned about keeping your gambling under control, sticking to some simple rules such as setting a money or time limit can help make the hard decisions for you when the time comes to walk away.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have questions or concerns about your own gambling or about that of a friend or family member, a good place to start is the National Gambling Helpline on Freephone 0808 8020 133.
			</p>
			<p>
				The National Gambling Helpline is operated by GamCare and offers free and confidential support, information and advice on problem gambling. It can also include direction to chat room forums and printed information depending on what you need and when.
			</p>
			<p>
				Always remember to set your limit and stay within it!
